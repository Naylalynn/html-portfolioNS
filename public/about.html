<h1>About Me</h1>

After graduating from Queen's in 2017, I went directly into chemistry due to knowing it was an area that needed to be strengthen. I have been a practicing chemist since gradiating in a variety of fields. I have worked in pharmaceuticals, nutraceutials and currently am a Research and Development Chemist for Chase Corporation.</p>
